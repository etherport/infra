# Session Log — narrative history

Append-only, **newest first**. One entry per substantive working session: what was
done, **why** (decisions/rationale that the code alone won't tell you), the state at
end, and explicit next steps. This is the artifact for resuming work if the chat
history is lost or you're picking up on a different machine.

**Maintenance:** add an entry at the end of every substantive session (see
[`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) §6). For the structured, ID'd to-do status, see
[`outstanding-work.md`](outstanding-work.md). Pre-2026-06-14 session history lives in
that tracker's "Recently completed" blocks and the dated planning docs
(`gcp-oidc-wif-l21.md`, `cloudflare-provider-v5-migration.md`, etc.).

## 2026-06-14 → 06-15 — UniFi Protect webhooks → HA, + HA automation behavior

**Goal:** Protect camera motion → HA light automations had stopped working
("webhooks not received by HA").

**Diagnosis journey (don't re-walk this):**
- Initial (pre-compaction) diagnosis blamed split-horizon DNS on the **UDM gateway**
  (`10.10.200.1`) resolving `ha.wind.etherport.net` to the Cloudflare edge → CF Access
  302. **That was the wrong host.** Protect runs on the **UNVR `Windprotect`
  (`10.10.212.10`)**, which uses Technitium and resolves `ha.wind` → `10.10.201.70`
  correctly (A + NODATA AAAA). A webhook POST from there returns HTTP 200. So DNS/
  network/HA were never the problem.
- A UDM Local DNS record was briefly added then **reverted** (owner: keep everything
  on Technitium for consistency — the UDM forwarding externally is by design).
- **Real root cause:** UniFi Protect's Alarm Manager webhook client has a bug — it
  feeds a multi-address `dns.lookup()` result into Node's single-IP connect path, so
  `net.isIP([ [Object] ])` throws **`ERR_INVALID_IP_ADDRESS`** and the request dies
  before any TCP connection. This breaks **every hostname-based webhook** (confirmed
  in `/srv/unifi-protect/logs/automationManager.log`: zero successful httpActions).
  Protect also **validates TLS**, so `https://10.10.201.70/...` (IP) fails
  `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`. Only an **IP-literal + plain-HTTP** URL works.

**Fix (shipped, commits `9fd7c50` + `840f6c0`):** a dedicated plain-HTTP Traefik
entrypoint `webhook` (`:8088`, no 80→443 redirect, no TLS) on the VIP, serving **only**
`PathPrefix(/api/webhook/)` → HA `:8123`. Files: `clusters/wind/helm-releases/traefik.yaml`
(the `webhook` port) + `platform/kubernetes/home-automation/ingressroute-webhook.yaml`.
Protect webhooks now use `http://10.10.201.70:8088/api/webhook/<id>`. Verified all 5
IDs return 200 from Protect; non-webhook paths 404 (least-exposure). Traefik rolled
zero-downtime (2 replicas, `maxUnavailable: 0`, PDB).

**Decisions / rejected options:**
- Rejected: HA macvlan IP (`10.10.202.25`) direct — firewalled from the camera VLAN.
- Rejected: source-lock the `:8088` route to Protect's IP via Traefik `ipAllowList` —
  the shared Traefik LB is `externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster` so kube-proxy SNATs the
  client IP and the allowlist 403s everything. Keeping it would need `Local` (cluster-
  wide ingress change) or a UDM firewall rule. **Owner declined** — the path is
  plain-HTTP, LAN-only, `/api/webhook/`-only, gated by 24-char secret IDs; marginal.
- The `protect-tf` 1P key authenticates the Protect **integration** API but that API
  is read-only for automations (no Alarm Manager endpoint), and the internal app API
  rejects it (401). So **the Alarm Manager URL edits can't be done via any API** —
  they're a Protect-UI task.

**HA automation behavior change (same session):** owner wanted re-triggered motion to
**reset** the off-timer (was ignored mid-run). Changed all 5 motion-light automations
from `mode: single` → **`mode: restart`** directly in `/config/automations.yaml`
(backup at `/config/automations.yaml.bak-premode-20260615-064254` in-pod; activated via
HA "Reload Automations"). Also clarified: editing/saving an automation mid-run cancels
the in-flight run (so a pending `turn_off` is abandoned → light stays on). `light.deck`
is a Hue light (healthy); the 03:40 deck-light-on event was *my* verification curl, not
real motion.

**State at end:** webhook path live + verified; automations on `restart`. Lights all
off. UDM DNS reverted. `protect-tf` temp key wiped from `/tmp`.

**Open / next steps:**
- ⏳ **Confirm all 5 Protect Alarm Manager URLs are switched** to
  `http://10.10.201.70:8088/api/webhook/<id>` (owner did some via UI; verify none still
  on `https://`/hostname or the old `https://10.10.202.25/...-bY8...`). UI-only.
- ⏳ (optional) add `protect-tf` to the SOPS bundle for headless Protect integration-API
  reads (camera/motion state for HA) — not needed for this fix.
- ⏳ (optional, declined) firewall source-lock for `:8088` — revisit only if desired.
- Relates to tracker **M48/M49/M50** (Protect IaC): webhook *routing* is now IaC;
  Alarm Manager automations remain UI-managed (no write API).
